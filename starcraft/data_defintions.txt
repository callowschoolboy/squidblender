Need hard and fast standards, e.g. if naming of say variables constantly changes there's a huge workload added to the overhead from
changing the codebase to accomodate those changes to simple naming.  

Under consideration:
------------
not having vars "mech, robo, bio" instead "Lockable, Spawnable, Irradable"
missing only when not known or very much N/A (as in it would be totally wrong to put any allowable value) otherwise things like 0
prefer two binaries to one trinary but 4+ nominal, start at 0 or at 1?
CamelCase with no spaces or abbrev
3 columns for primkey, UnitName DamageMethod and Modifiers, sorresponding to the delimiters of unit_wp  This would mean upgrades seperate ds
adjusting for heal/regen/repair to get "sitting duck toughness"
